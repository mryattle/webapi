title: What is an API ?

“What’s an API?” When a new programmer asks this question, they  typically get the answer, “an application programming interface.”

But APIs are so much more than their name suggests and to understand and unleash their value, we must focus on the keyword *interface*.

An API is the interface that a software program presents to other  programs, to humans, and, in the case of web APIs, to the world via the  internet. An API’s design belies much about the program behind  it business model, product features, the occasional bug. Although APIs  are designed to work with other programs, they’re mostly intended to be  understood and used by *humans* writing those other programs.

An *application programming interface (API)* is an interface or communication protocol between a client and a server intended to simplify the building of client-side software. It has been  described as a “contract” between the client and the server, such that  if the client makes a request in a specific format, it will always get a response in a specific format or initiate a defined action.

An API may  be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library. 

After about 30 years, the APIs emerged from their local environments and in the early 2000s they became an important technology for remote data integration.

APIs offer an easy way to connect, integrate and extend a software system. More precisely, the APIs are used for the creation of distributed software systems, whose components are freely coupled. The APIs studied here are Web APIs, which are implemented as Web services and provide data resources through a stack of Web technologies. Typical applications that use APIs are mobile apps, cloud apps, Web applications or smart devices.

## Why APIs are important ?

APIs have emerged out of a need to exchange information with providers of data who are equipped to solve specific problems, so folks at other companies don't have to spend time solve specific problems themselves.

For example, you might want to embed an interactive map on a web page without reinventing Google Maps. You might want to have a user sign in without having to reinvent Facebook Login.

In all there cases, supplementary features and products are created using data or interactions from a specialised platform. APIs enable businesses to develop unique products quickly. Rather than reinventing the wheel, startups are able to differentiate their product offerings while taking advantage of existing technologies and tapping into other ecosystems.

If we want to know why API are so important we should consider different perspectives. Both APIs developers and business are directly involved in decision making processes.

### Developer perspective

Without APIs in our tool belt, most software couldn’t exist. It’s not just access to the data we need, but it’s also the mechanics of many  other APIs that we depend on to make software go.

Making your own API involves creating a front door to your data which  can thrilling and terrifying all at once because on one hand, you can  access your data warehouse from your software, while on the other hand,  so can anyone else with the right keys.

On the Web, APIs make it possible for big services like Google Maps or Facebook to let other apps “piggyback” on their offerings. Think about the way Yelp, for instance, displays nearby restaurants on a Google Map in its app, or the way some video games now let players chat, post high scores and invite friends to play via Facebook, right there in the middle of a game.

APIs exposes some of a program’s internal functions to the outside world in a limited fashion.  That makes it possible for applications to share data and take actions on one another’s behalf without requiring developers to share all of their software’s code. 

Combing through all the code for somebody else’s application can be awfully messy when you just want to use one function. APIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. Feel free to think of them as doors, windows or levers if you like. Whatever the metaphor, APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world saving time, resources and potentially nasty legal entanglements along the way. 

### Business perspective

APIs, or application program interfaces, are vital tools for businesses in all industries. The importance of APIs from a technical standpoint, they allow the capabilities of one computer program to be used by another. They are a means by which two different programs are able to communicate. APIs enable companies to grow their businesses more quickly than ever before, and represent an answer for the organizations that are currently spending billions per year integrating disparate systems. Like the Web, which opened up the Internet’s potential, APIs are driving a new wave of innovation centered on sharing services. Organizations in all industries are looking to learn more about APIs and their potential to transform business processes.

The main reason that APIs matter so much in modern markets is that they allow for faster innovation. Barriers to change are reduced and more people can contribute to an organization’s success. They offer two-fold benefits: the company can create better products while standing out from the competition. APIs also make monetization easier. Having a presence on more platforms means that companies can sell more ad space. According to ReadWrite, any service that is transactional or advertising-driven benefits from multiple interfaces. APIs should therefore be implemented for platforms like the iPhone, Facebook, browser extensions and more.

An API particularly comes into play when companies or organizations invest in software to help run their business. While most CRM, ERP, CMS software vendors provide APIs for their software, this is not always true for vertical software. This type of software is usually built with an industry segment in mind, like pharmaceuticals, theater groups or doctors. You name an industry, someone has probably tried to write and sell software for it. Those that succeed often know their industry very well but may not have thought about the long term needs or have the sophistication required for some organizations. 

A company's business can be expanded by linking the organizational processes that are part of the value chain. As companies are managed by IT, companies can be better connected by integrating a company's IT systems up and down the value chain, even with IT systems from other companies, partners, employees and customers. This can be achieved if the IT systems of the trading partners are connected via services.
